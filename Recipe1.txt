>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Method<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

1.Put the turkey mince into a large bowl. Take the 
grated courgette in handfuls and squeeze well to remove
 excess water, before adding to the bowl.Toss in the 
dried herbs, bicarbonate of soda, chilli flakes and 
capers, season with salt and pepper and mix well.

2.Divide the mixture into four equal portions and 
shape into burgers.Place on a baking tray lined 
with baking parchment, cover and refrigerate while 
you make the slaw.

3.Put all the cabbage into a bowl, sprinkle with 
the salt and mix well.Leave to stand for 20 minutes,
 then rinse thoroughly and drain well. Mix in the 
other coleslaw ingredients.

4.Preheat the oven to 240C/220C Fan/Gas 7 Fan. Remove
 the burgers from the fridge and spray each one with a 
couple of sprays of oil. Cook on the top shelf of the 
oven for about 12 minutes, or until golden-brown and 
cooked through.

5.Lay a slice of mozzarella on each burger and cook 
for a further 4–5 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.

6.Place a turkey burger inside each bun, if serving. 
Top with a slice of tomato and a handful of rocket 
leaves, then close the bun lids.Serve with the coleslaw 
on the side.
