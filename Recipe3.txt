>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Methods<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

1.To prepare the dough:Place the masarepa in a large
 bowl.Add the sazon Goya and salt and stir to mix well.
 Add the water and oil and mix to form dough. Pat the
 dough into a ball and knead for 2 minutes or until smooth.
 Cover with plastic and set aside for 20 minutes.

2.Meanwhile, to make the filling, cook the potatoes in 
 a pot with water and the bouillon tablet for 20-25 minutes
 or until tender. Drain and gently mash the potatoes. 
 Set aside.Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy
 skillet.Add the onion and cook over medium-low heat 
 stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.Add the tomatoes, 
 green onions, garlic, bell pepper, cilantro, salt and black pepper. 
 Cook for about 15 minutes.

3.Add the ground pork and beef. Cook, breaking up the meat 
 with a wooden spoon, for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture is fairly  dry.Transfer the meat mixture to the mashed potatoes bowl
 and mix well to combine.

4.Break small portions of the dough, about 1 ½ tablespoons 
 each one, and form each portion into a ball by rolling 
 between the palms of your hands.Place the balls of dough 
 between two pieces of plastic and roll each out very thinly
 to form a circle.Remove the top plastic and place 1 tablespoon 
 of the filling in the center of each.Then using the plastic underneath,  fold the dough over to enclose the filling, forming a half circle. 

5.Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.
 Fill a large pot with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat to 360° F.
 Carefully place 3 or 4 empanadas at the time in the heated oil and fry for  about 2 minutes until golden on all sides.
 Using a slotted spoon transfer the empanadas to a plate lined with paper  towels. Serve with ají and lime on the side.
