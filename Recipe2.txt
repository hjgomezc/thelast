>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Method<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

1.Crush the peppercorns, mustard powder, thyme and 
celery seeds together with some salt, using a pestle 
and mortar. Stir in the oil, then rub it all over the 
beef.(If you have time, cover and chill the joint 
overnight to marinate. Bring the beef out of the fridge
 1 hr before roasting.)

2.Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and sit the joint in 
a snug-ish roasting tin.Roast for 12 mins per 450g/1lb 
(about 55 mins for a 2kg/4lb 8oz joint) for medium-rare, 
or 15 mins per 450g/1lb (about 1 hr 10 mins) for medium-well.

3.Remove from the oven, lift onto a platter, cover with foil 
and rest for 30 mins.If you’re making the Yorkies (p90), 
increase oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.

4.For the gravy, pour any juices from the roasting tin into a
 jug.Let the juices separate, then spoon 2 tbsp of the fat back 
into the tin – if there is no fat, use 2 tbsp butter instead. 
Discard any other fat. Sit the roasting tin on the hob and stir 
in the flour, stock cubes, onion chutney or marmalade and Marmite. 
Cook for 1 min,stirring well to scrape up any beefy bits stuck to 
the tin, then gradually stir in 750ml hot water from the kettle. 
 Bubble to thicken to a nice consistency, then gently keep warm 
until ready to serve with the beef,carved into slices.
